# Flood History of Structures in Boulder, CO
The City of Boulder offers a [rich dataset of floodplain delineations](https://open-data.bouldercolorado.gov/datasets/bfc343d63cf54831810b983b36ce6872_5/about) going all the way back to the late 1970's. With all the hubbub going on over [annexation of the CU South property](https://www.boulderweekly.com/news/the-controversy-surrounding-cu-south-explained/), I became curious about what floodplain history looks like for Boulder's buildings. This project uses open source GIS tools paired with the city's open data to visualize that history.
